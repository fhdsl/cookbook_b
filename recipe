9 inch round cake pans
spatula set
measuring cups and spoons
kitchenaid mixer

Ingredients  

▢1 3/4 cups Flour
▢1 3/4 cups Sugar
▢3/4 cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
▢2 teaspoons Baking Powder
▢1 teaspoon Baking Soda
▢1 teaspoon Salt
▢1/2 cup Oil
▢2 large Eggs
▢1 cup Buttermilk
▢1 teaspoon Orange Extract
▢1 teaspoon Orange Zest
▢1/2 cup Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice
▢1/2 cup Hot Water
Chocolate Orange Frosting:
▢1 1/2 cups Butter (softened)
▢1 cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
▢5 to 5 1/2 cups Powdered Sugar
▢1 Tablespoon Orange Juice
▢1/2 teaspoon Orange Extract

Instructions 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. If you have a flour sifter, sift all dry ingredients.
In mixing bowl, beat oil, eggs, buttermilk, orange zest, orange juice, and orange extract for 1 minute. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and stir until combined. Pour in hot water and mix together. The batter will be liquidy but that's a good thing -- it will create a moist cake.
Spray two 9-inch or three 8-inch cake pans with non-stick cooking spray. Pour batter evenly into each pan. Bake at 22-27 minutes. Place toothpick or cake tester in the center of the cake to check if it comes out clean. Let cool before frosting.
Chocolate Orange Frosting:
In mixing bowl, cream together butter, cocoa, powdered sugar, orange juice, and orange extract until light and fluffy. May add cream or milk depending on consistency.
Once the cake has cooled and has been removed from pans, frost each layer with frosting.Top with sweet dried oranges dipped in chocolate.
