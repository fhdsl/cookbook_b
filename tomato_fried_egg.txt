Ingredients:
3 eggs 
2 tomatoes (cut into chunks or wedges)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon white pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon soy sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon cooking oil (vegetable or peanut oil)
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
1 clove garlic (optional), minced
Chopped green onions (optional)

Instructions:
Beat the eggs – Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt, and whisk until well combined.
Cook the eggs – Heat 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and stir-fry until just set but still soft. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Stir-fry the tomatoes – In the same pan, add the remaining oil. If using garlic, sauté it until fragrant, then add the tomatoes. Season with salt, sugar, and soy sauce. Stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes soften and release their juices.
Combine – Return the scrambled eggs to the pan and gently mix them with the tomatoes. Add a few drops of sesame oil for extra flavor.
Serve – Garnish with chopped green onions and enjoy with steamed rice.
